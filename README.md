## **Project Description**
***
This command line app quickly generates an HTML file which when opened in a browser displays a simple, but informative Company Team Profile Page. Upon start of the app, the user answers questions from the Inquirer commandline prompts.</br>Each answer is collected, processed then applied to the appropriate line in a HTML file.</br>Team Profile Generator frees up time for busy managers or HR departments and ensures basic employee data is easily recorded and managed.
